            <h3><b>Graphical Evidence of Track and Field Innovation</b></h3>
            <p>As an introduction to data science, I made a series of python scripts which generate graphs using
                <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>.
                The produced graphs measure Olympic track and field times since 1896, that yield
                intriguing and consistent results, indicating a pretty clear and consistent improvement in race times
                over the last hundred years. The data represented in the graph could be useful to someone innovating
                the track and field sphere, as they could see which years had the largest improvements, and which
                innovations may have come around the time.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Features and Usage</b></h3>
            <p>To use the project, open
                <a href="https://github.com/BenBredesen/data-analysis-mini-probject">this</a> GitHub repository.
                Then, download either one of the files titled 'event.py', for example 400m.py, or download general.py
                which can display any event. Once downloaded, run the file in your terminal or IDE. The general.py
                file takes multiple inputs, allowing you to specify the event and number of events to graph.</p>

          <!--      <p>As an introduction to data science, I made a series of python scripts using matplotlib and pandas. These scripts load a CSV file containing historical Olympic track and field data, then use pandas to analyze the data, and matplotlib to generate a graph. The graphs produced with this data yield intriguing results, displaying a pretty clear and consistent improvement in race times since 1896. The data represented in the graph could be useful to someone innovating the track and field sphere, as they could see which years had the largest improvements, and which innovations may have come around the time.</p>-->

            <h3><b>A Simple, Fun Game</b></h3>
            <p>In Ball Breakout, the user must direct and buy bouncing balls to break blocks that spawn in waves across the board. The player gains money from each block broken and has to manage their funds effectively to balance buying and upgrading various types of balls. They also need to balance buying different types of balls as some balls work well against strong bricks and some balls work better against groups of bricks. Not only does the user buy balls, but each ball has various attributes that can be upgraded to improve anything from damage to accuracy.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Features and Usage</b></h3>
            <p>To play the game, go to
                <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/limeGreenKitten8394">this link</a>.
                Follow the in-game tutorial to buy your first ball, then return to the main screen and watch it break the blocks. Return to the purchase page to buy more balls or visit the upgrade page to upgrade your existing balls. Ball Breakout is a single-player game that continues infinitely.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Shortcuts</b></h3>
            <p>To speed up the game, you can press Q to gain $100, or press W to spawn the next wave.

            <h3><b>Convert Between Markdown Files and HTML Files</b></h3>
            <p>For this project, I worked with two other students in my class to create a python file that can
                convert basic markdown files into html code. Similar code to ours is used in most websites that can
                display markdown. For example, GitHub uses something similar to display readme.md files on their
                website.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Features and Usage</b></h3>
            <p>To use the converter, go to
                <a href="https://github.com/Shayan-Farhan/InterPy_MdToHtmlCompiler">this</a> GitHub repository.
                Download the markdown_converter.py file and run it in your terminal or IDE. It takes a list of
                markdown file names as an input, and will output a new html file for each inputted file.
